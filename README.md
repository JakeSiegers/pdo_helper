# pdo_helper
A PHP pdo_mysql helper class to make it easier to use.
The goal of this library is to keep PDO mysql simple and easy to use, while making it easier to port your older mysql code. You'll find this libary has a very similar api, so if you are used to old-school mysql programming in php, learning this new library will be a breeze.


# Usage
```
$dbc = new pdo_helper();
```
